          About Marilyn&apos;s Morsels
        </h1>
        <p className="text-base text-morselBrown/80 leading-relaxed">
          Marilyn&apos;s Morsels began in a home kitchen, where every batch was tested on brutally
          honest friends and family until the recipe was right every time. Today, each order is
          baked in a licensed home kitchen with the same care: real butter, premium chocolate, and a
          strict &quot;no shortcuts&quot; policy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-morselBrown/80 leading-relaxed">
          We keep the menu focused so every morsel that leaves the oven is consistent: golden edges,
          soft centers, and flavors that actually justify reordering.
        </p>

                I&apos;ve loved baking cookies since I was in the fifth grade, and I especially love
                the aroma it creates in my home. When my kids were in school, I had to keep a batch
                of cookies at the ready for them and their friends.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, many years later, those friends still keep in touch, pleading with me to share
                my tasty cookies with their kids.
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold text-morselCocoa">What an honor that is!</p>
              <p>
                Nine grandkids later, the aroma of fresh baked cookies still permeates my home, and
                my grandkids love helping me bake! I now love seeing the excitement of people&apos;s
                faces when I deliver them cookies. It&apos;s time for you to see why my family, my
                kids&apos; friends, and my current friends love my cookies!
              </p>
